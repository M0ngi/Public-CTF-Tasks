# National Cyber Security Congress

[NCSC](https://www.facebook.com/NationalCSC), organized by Securinets, in it's 4th edition included a 12-hour CTF. As a technical team member, I had the chance to write some Binary Exploitation & Jail challenges. The tasks were a bit challenging & I'm glad a few enjoyed their time, despite the lack of solves.

This is going to be a writeup for the following challenges:
* [ObjectOrientedJail](#ObjectOrientedJail) (PyJail)
* [PyCryptoJail](#PyCryptoJail) (PyJail)
* [Formatter Specialist](#formatter-specialist) (Pwn)

For the challenge files & solvers:
* [ObjectOrientedJail](/2023/NCSC/src/objectorientedjail)
* [PyCryptoJail](/2023/NCSC/src/pycryptojail)
* [Formatter Specialist](/2023/NCSC/src/formatterspecialist)
